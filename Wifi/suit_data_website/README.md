# Metrics Website

This webpage is copied to the SD card on the ESP32 and served from the Access Point, showing suit metrics. The index page must be named `index.htm`, not `.html` for reasons unknown. This site must be statically generated. It can get data from a json file (or other text file), parsed from client-side javascript.
