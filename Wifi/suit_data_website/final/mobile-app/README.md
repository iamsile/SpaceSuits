# Cordova App

tested on Ubuntu 18. first run `npm i`. Then run `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre`. Then you need to install the android sdk using [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34556884/how-to-install-android-sdk-on-ubuntu). DO NOT install with apt - it won't work :(.

Follow [these instructions](https://codeburst.io/publish-a-cordova-generated-android-app-to-the-google-play-store-c7ae51cccdd5) for getting the app signed and stuff.
