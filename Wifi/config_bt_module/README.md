# BT Module Config

following steps from [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Modify-The-HC-05-Bluetooth-Module-Defaults-Using-A/). Was trying to make name and other info from bluetooth module configurable. However, it does not currently work. It might work but in the process of developing the code I bricked the module. Will probably not attempt with this setup again.
